# vera-website-angular
Utilises Angular to create a simple website with variable themes, and a responsive grid for viewing in both desktop and mobile. In the case the website has separate tabs that can be flicked between instead of utalising a the usual navigation bar with routing setup. This means there is no page loading. This makes the application great for blogs, and portfolios.
